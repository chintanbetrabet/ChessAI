The Folder consists of various versions of chess that i gradually developed.
Board.txt contains initial layout of Pieces.
Open "Chess CPU vs Player -Final.py" to run the game
The game is run on minimax. Moves can be made by typing the position of starting piece and final position.
List of positions is attached in excel-sheet.top left of the board(Black's side) is assigned 0 and all others are numbered accordingly.
I am also attaching the attempt at RL. It is not as intelligent as minimax as of now. It displays the current weights of each piece in the Board variable at the end of each move.
Please add any suggestions.
