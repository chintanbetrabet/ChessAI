S'WOW! WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT! More than 100x! This has the least underestimation of path cost among the 4. This is the manhattan tour; distance taken to cover all treasures. dist(curr, t1) + dist(t1, t2) + dist(t2, t3) etc. This shows how powerful A* is. Turns out this need not be admissible always. We got lucky this time.'

S"An easy heuristic. Can't expect much from this. Easily admissible and consistent."

p5
S'Better than before. Our agent obviously has to cover at least the distance to closest treasure.'

p7
S"Farthest treasure. Agent has to cover all remaining treasures -> agent has to cover the farthest treasure also -> actual cost >= distance to farthest treasure. Farthest >= Closest -> doesn't understimate path cost as much as closest -> can expect better performance"
